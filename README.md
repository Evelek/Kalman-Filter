Kalman Filter is an algorithm that lets us to rectify some datas.

In the picture below we can see 3 graphs. The first one at the top shows the real position of the object.
The second one in the middle shows the position that was measured by a device.
The last one at the bottom shows the position of the object that was corrected by Kalman Filter Algorithm.
